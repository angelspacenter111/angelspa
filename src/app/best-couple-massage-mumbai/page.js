                                            <h2>Why Choose a Couple Massage?</h2>
                                            <p>A <strong>couple massage</strong> is more than just a spa therapy – it’s an experience that enhances bonding and intimacy between partners. Here’s why it’s so special:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>Shared Experience</strong> – Both partners receive massages side by side in the same private room, creating a sense of connection.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>Stress Relief Together</strong> – Life in Mumbai can be hectic. A couple massage helps reduce stress for both partners at once.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>Quality Time</strong> – Instead of watching a movie or dining out, a spa session gives you meaningful time together.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>Improved Relationship</strong> – Touch therapy releases oxytocin, the “love hormone,” helping couples feel closer.
