                                    <h5>Traditional Thai Massage</h5>
                                    <p>The traditional Thai massage is a unique experience that combines acupressure, gentle stretching, and rhythmic compression. Unlike other massages, Thai massage is often performed without oils and focuses on applying pressure along the body's energy lines. This treatment helps improve flexibility, relieve tension, and increase energy flow throughout your body. Many clients report feeling relaxed and invigorated after a session, as if they have pressed a reset button on their bodies.</p>
                                    <h5>Aromatherapy Massage</h5>
                                    <p>Aromatherapy massage uses essential oils to relax the mind and body. At {name}, we use high-quality, natural oils that are known for their healing properties. Each session begins with selecting an essential oil that suits your mood and needs, such as lavender for relaxation, eucalyptus for clearing the mind, or lemongrass for uplifting energy. The combination of aromatherapy and massage provides a multi-sensory experience that leaves you feeling refreshed and balanced.</p>
                                    <h5>Deep Tissue Massage</h5>

                                    <h5>Foot Reflexology</h5>
                                    <p>Based on the principles of reflexology, our foot massage focuses on applying pressure to specific points on the feet that correspond to different organs and systems in the body.
