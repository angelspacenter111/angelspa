                                        <h3>What is a Head Massage?</h3>
                                        <p>A head massage, often referred to as a scalp massage or Indian head massage, is a therapeutic technique that focuses on the head, neck, and shoulders.

At <Link href={base_url}><b>Angel Spa Center</b></Link>, our head massages are tailored to meet your specific needs, ensuring a personalized experience that leaves you refreshed and revitalized.</p>
