                                            <h2>What is a Hot Stone Massage?</h2>
                                            <p>A hot stone massage is a relaxing therapy that uses smooth, heated basalt stones placed on your body and during massage. The stones are warmed to a safe temperature and placed on areas like your back, shoulders, or hands. The heat relaxes muscles, improves blood flow, and reduces stress. The therapist uses the stones to massage, blending traditional techniques with warmth for deeper relief.</p>
